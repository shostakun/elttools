# EikaiwaLab's ELT Tools

See the tools [here](https://eikaiwalab.com/tools).

These are ELT teaching tools I've built for my own use over the years. Many/most of them have been designed with online lessons in mind, but I use them in classroom settings as well. Each has some info about how I use them.

I'm just getting started cleaning up the old stuff and integrating it into a single Vue application, so there's not much to see yet.
